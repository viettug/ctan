ABOUT

	This small tool is used to seach/download some LaTeX packages that were listed in CTAN:
		http://ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/
	or search/download any files in
		http://ctan.org/tex-archive/.

	Since version 1.0.1 the tool uses the cache file
		http://kyanh.net/ctan.tools//cache.tbz
	This file contains the list of all files in CTAN. It's updated daily by a cron job hosted
	by http://kyanh.net/. The size of file is about 400k.

	The tool requires wget, lynx, gawk, wc, tar/bzip and sed program to run correctly.
	Some linux distributions donot contain lynx by default and you must install lynx manually
	before running this script. So this tool requires a *nix-liked environment to work.
	texer <VietTUG> tested and reported that the tool worked fine in Cygwin environment.
